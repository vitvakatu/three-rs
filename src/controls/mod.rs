//! ## Controllers
//!
//! Controllers are used to orient objects in the scene using input devices.
//! Any [`Object`] can be the target of a controller, including cameras.
//!
//! ### Orbital
//!
//!  * Uses mouse movement to rotate the object around its target.
//!  * Uses the mouse scroll wheel to move the object closer to or further
//!    from its target.
//!
//! ### First-person
//!
//!  * Uses the W and S keys to move forward or backward.
//!  * Uses the A and D keys to strafe left or right.
//!  * Uses mouse movement to rotate the object when the right mouse button
//!    is held down.
